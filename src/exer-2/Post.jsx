        <p>Japan's government has created emergency measures to address record numbers of bear attacks. The Ministry of Environment reported that 13 people have been killed, and more than 100 have been injured by bears since April. The death toll is the highest since records began in 2006. Wildlife management experts have devised a plan to reduce the increasing numbers of fatalities, injuries, and encounters with bears. Part of this plan is to reduce bear populations in areas where the animals have been sighted. Another feature is the establishment of region-specific capture targets. Authorities will also set up a buffer zone in many areas to try to separate bear habitats from human residential areas.</p>
